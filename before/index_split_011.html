  <p class="calibre_6">A year after the insurrection, I’m trying to imagine the death of American democracy. It’s
    somehow easier to picture the Earth blasted and bleached by global warming, or the human brain overtaken by the
    tyranny of artificial intelligence, than to foresee the end of our 250-year experiment in self-government.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">The usual scenarios are unconvincing. The country is not going to split into two hostile sections
    and fight a war of secession. No dictator will send his secret police to round up dissidents in the dead of night.
    Analogies like these bring the comfort of at least being familiar. Nothing has aided Donald Trump more than
    Americans’ failure of imagination. It’s essential to picture an unprecedented future so that what may seem
    impossible doesn’t become inevitable.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Before January 6, no one—<a
      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/capitol-riot-senate-police-intelligence/2021/02/23/bd4cba38-75d7-11eb-8115-9ad5e9c02117_story.html">including
      intelligence professionals</a>—could have conceived of a president provoking his followers to smash up the
    Capitol. Even the rioters livestreaming in National Statuary Hall seemed stunned by what they were doing. The siege
    felt like a wild shot that could have been fatal. For a nanosecond, shocked politicians of both parties sang
    together from the hymnal of democracy. But the unity didn’t last. The past months have made it clear that <a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/january-6-insurrection-trump-coup-2024-election/620843/">the
      near miss was a warning shot</a>.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6"><a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/january-6-insurrection-trump-coup-2024-election/620843/">Read:
      January 6 was practice</a></p>
  <p class="calibre_6">If the end comes, it will come through democracy itself. Here’s one way I imagine it could
    happen: In 2024, disputed election results in several states lead to tangled proceedings in courtrooms and
    legislatures. The Republican Party’s long campaign of undermining faith in elections leaves voters on both sides
    deeply skeptical of any outcome they don’t like. When the next president is finally chosen by the Supreme Court or
    Congress, half the country explodes in rage. Protests soon turn violent, and the crowds are met with lethal force by
    the state, while instigators firebomb government buildings. Neighborhoods organize self-defense groups, and
    law-enforcement officers take sides or go home. Predominantly red or blue counties turn on political minorities. A
    family with a Biden-Harris sign has to abandon home on a rural road and flee to the nearest town. A blue militia
    sacks Trump National Golf Club Bedminster; a red militia storms Oberlin College. The new president takes power in a
    state of siege.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Few people would choose this path. It’s the kind of calamity into which fragile societies stumble
    when their leaders are reckless, selfish, and shortsighted. But some Americans actually long for an armed showdown.
    In an <a href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/right-flight/">article</a> for the <span class="italic">Claremont
      Review of Books</span> imagining how the cultural conflict between blue California and red Texas might play out,
    Michael Anton, a former Trump White House adviser, recently wrote:</p>
  <blockquote class="calibre_20">If the Lone Star way of life is to survive, Texans must fight for it. Then we shall see
    whether California’s long experiment with postmodern deracination and anti-masculinity can stand up to Texas’s more
    robust embrace of the old virtues. I’m not a betting man, but were that conflict to erupt, my money would be on
    Texas.</blockquote>
  <p class="calibre_6">Imagining the worst is a civic duty; cheering it on is political arson.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Another, likelier scenario is widespread cynicism. Following the election crisis, protests burn
    out. Americans lapse into acquiescence, believing that all leaders lie, all voting is rigged, all media are bought,
    corruption is normal, and any appeal to higher values such as freedom and equality is either fraudulent or naive.
    The loss of democracy turns out not to matter all that much. The hollowed core of civic life brings a kind of
    relief. Citizens indulge themselves in self-care and the metaverse, where politics turns into a private game and
    algorithms drive Americans into ever more extreme views that have little relation to reality or relevance to those
    in power. There’s enough wealth to keep the population content. America’s transformation into Russia is complete.

  <p class="calibre_6">We know what’s driving us toward this cataclysm: not simply Trump, but the Republican Party. By
    the usual standards, Trump’s postpresidency has been as pathetic as the forced exile of any minor dictator—Idi Amin
    poolside in Jeddah. Much of Trump’s nongolfing time is devoted to fending off criminal charges against his business.
    Banned from Twitter and Facebook, he started a blog that was so anemic, he had to shut it down. His sore-loser
    rallies are desultory. And yet, in the year since the insurrection, the party has aligned itself so completely with
    his sense of grievance and lust for revenge that there’s no room for dissent.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">The insurrection and the lie that instigated it are not tools that Republicans can put away when
    it suits them.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Establishment Republicans believe they’ve found a way to return to power: mollify the base and
    keep Trump at a distance, while appealing to suburban moderates with conventional issues such as education and
    inflation. Sooner or later, the party will be cleansed of Trump’s stain. But this is wishful thinking, and not just
    because he’s almost certain to run again in 2024. A party can’t be half-democratic and half-authoritarian. The
    insurrection and the lie that instigated it are not tools that Republicans can put away when it suits them. The
    corruption is too deep.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6"><a

      A. Graham: January 6 has become the New Lost Cause of Donald Trump</a></p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Most Republican voters believe that the last election was stolen and that the next one likely
    will be too. Some have come to embrace the insurrection as a sacred cause. Ashli Babbitt, the invader killed by a
    Capitol Police officer, <a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/donald-trumps-new-lost-cause-centers-january-6/620407/">has
      become a martyr</a>. Steve Bannon’s podcast, which rallies the conspiracy-minded to take over the party from the
    ground up, has <a
      href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/09/bannon-podcast-trump-election-county-precinct-workers.html">tens
      of millions of downloads</a>. “Election security” (a euphemism for the myth of rampant fraud) has become the top
    issue for candidates in heavily Republican states like Oklahoma, where <a
      href="https://thehill.com/gop-lawmakers/582309-gop-senate-candidate-says-fauci-is-mass-murderer-should-be-jailed-rather-than">an
      extremist pastor named Jackson Lahmeyer</a> is running against Senator James Lankford over his vote to certify
    President Joe Biden’s win. Even the “moderate” Glenn Youngkin, Virginia’s new governor, refused to acknowledge Biden
    as the legitimate president until after the state’s Republican nominating convention. Republicans who dared to
    criticize Trump have become the objects of more visceral hatred than any Democrat; most have prudently gone silent.
    Those few who have the temerity to tell the truth are being pushed out of the party.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers around the country have spent the year stacking state election
    offices with partisans who can be counted on to do Trump’s bidding next time. State legislatures have tried, in many
    cases successfully, to pass laws that will make it easier to manipulate or overturn election results and intimidate
    nonpartisan officials by criminalizing minor infractions. In state after state, Republicans have tried to make it
    harder for Americans, especially Democratic constituencies, to vote. This tireless campaign of legislation and
    disinformation has set in motion an irreversible process of electoral sabotage.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">In a sense, the Republican Party now functions like an insurgency. It has a legal, legitimate
    wing that conducts politics as usual and an underground wing that threatens violence. The first wing is made up of
    leaders such as Senator Mitch McConnell and Representative Kevin McCarthy, who oppose Democratic bills, stoke
    conservative anger over progressive policies, and try to stay clear of Trump’s fantasies and vendettas. But every
    day they collaborate with party figures in the underground wing, whose lies mobilize the base, and whose goal is not
    so much to refight the last election as to give a pretext for fixing future ones. McConnell and Senator Lindsey
    Graham quietly bemoan Trump’s obsession with fraud, as if “Stop the Steal” is just a personal fixation that hurts
    the party, not a path to power.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Not even Senator Mitt Romney will take a single step that could save democracy. The Freedom to
    Vote Act is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/10/joe-manchin-voting-rights/620439/">a
      compromise bill between progressive and moderate Democrats</a> that would establish national rules for voting
    rights—heading off state laws that limit ballot access and enable partisan attempts to throw out legitimate votes.
    But Romney won’t join Democrats to pass it, or even let it be brought up for debate. (No Republican will—which is
    why the filibuster has become such a powerful weapon in the hands of antidemocrats.) Romney doesn’t lack moral
    courage. He voted twice, once as the lone Republican, to throw Trump out of office. But after that crisis passed, he
    returned to the narrow thinking of a party man. It seems Romney can’t bring himself to imagine that democracy is
    threatened not just by Trump, but by his own party.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Democrats suffer from a different failure of imagination. They regularly sound the alarm about
    the threat to democracy, but it is one of many alarms, along with those over the pandemic, child care, health care,
    criminal justice, guns, climate change. All of these deserve urgent attention, but they can’t be equally urgent.
    Biden has spent far less of his political capital on saving democracy than on passing an infrastructure bill.
    According to <a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/news/52-americans-believe-democracy-facing-major-threat">a Grinnell
      College poll in October</a>, only 35 percent of Democrats believe that American democracy faces a “major threat.”
    The figure is twice as large for Republicans—whose belief in a major threat <span class="italic">is</span> the
    threat. Delusion about the danger prevails in both parties.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">If Mitt Romney and Susan Collins are all that stand between the republic and its foes, we’re
    doomed.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">When Democrats talk about the threat, they focus on disenfranchisement, describing the new
    Republican election laws as “Jim Crow 2.0.” The language, by provocatively invoking that terrible history,
    highlights the racial bias in the laws. But the threat we face is a new one; it requires new thinking. Through most
    of American history, both parties, while excluding large numbers of Americans from the franchise, basically accepted
    the choice of the electorate—and that is no longer true. The supreme danger now is not that voters in urban counties
    will have a harder time finding a drop box, or that some states will shorten the mail-ballot application window. The
    danger is that the express will of the American people could be overthrown.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Failures of imagination result from the expectation that what has always happened will continue
    to happen, even in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary. They console us with the belief that the worst
    won’t befall people like us. Europe had never known a Hitler, and so the Western powers thought they were dealing
    with a comic-opera maniac, even as he made no secret of his plans for a genocidal slave empire. The United States
    had never seen mass slaughter by foreign terrorists on its soil, and so the planes of September 11 <a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/09/the-911-century/619487/">seemed to come out of the
      blue</a>, though al-Qaeda had been trying to kill Americans for a decade. Citizens of liberal democracies are
    particularly unequipped to see these eruptions in history coming, because our system of government is founded, as
    Jefferson wrote, on a belief in “the sufficiency of human reason for the care of human affairs.” It’s hard to accept
    that the foundation of democracy is quite this fragile.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/09/the-911-century/619487/">From the
      September 2021 issue: 9/11 was a warning of what was to come</a></p>
  <p class="calibre_6">For all the violence and oppression of American history, we’ve enjoyed the steadiest democratic
    run in the modern world. Political stability and national wealth allowed many Americans to go long periods
    relatively untouched by politics. The end of Trump’s cruel and frenzied presidency seemed to promise a return to the
    old comforts of the private sphere. Realizing that his defeat gives no respite exhausts me even more than his years
    in office.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">There is no easy way to stop a major party that’s intent on destroying democracy. The demonic
    energy with which Trump repeats his lies, and Bannon harangues his audience, and Republican politicians around the
    country try to seize every lever of election machinery—this relentless drive for power by American authoritarians is
    the major threat that America confronts. The Constitution doesn’t have an answer. No help will come from Republican
    leaders; if Romney and Susan Collins are all that stand between the republic and its foes, we’re doomed.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">There is a third scenario, though, beyond mass violence or mass cynicism: <a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/civics-education-1619-crt/618894/">a civic movement to
      save democracy</a>. In an age of extreme polarization, it would take the form of a broad alliance of the left and
    the center-right. This democratic coalition would have to imagine America’s political suicide without distractions
    or illusions. And it would have to take precedence over everything else in politics.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6"><a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/civics-education-1619-crt/618894/">George Packer: Can
      civics save America?</a></p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Citizens will have to do boring things—run for obscure local election offices and volunteer as
    poll watchers—with the same unflagging energy as the enemies of democracy. Decent Republicans will have to work and
    vote for Democrats, and Democrats will have to work and vote for anti-Trump Republicans or independents in races
    where no Democrat has a chance to win. Congressional Democrats and the Biden administration will have to make the
    Freedom to Vote Act their top priority, altering or ending the filibuster to give this democratic fire wall a chance
    to become law.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">It will be no easy matter to defy the prevailing forces in American politics—those that
    continually push us toward the extremes, to the benefit of elites in technology, media, and politics. A cycle of
    mutual antagonism normalizes illiberal thinking on all sides. The illiberalism of progressives—still no match for
    that of the antidemocratic right—consists of an ideology of identity that tolerates little dissent. As a political
    strategy, it has proved self-destructive. Ignoring ordinary citizens’ reasonable anxieties about crime, immigration,
    and education—or worse, dismissing them as racist—only encourages the real racists on the right, fails to turn out
    the left, and infuriates the middle. The ultimate winner will be Trump.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">The overriding concern of democratic citizens must be the survival and strength of the alliance.
    They will have to resist going to the mat over issues that threaten to tear it apart. The point is not to abandon
    politics, but to pursue it wisely. Avoid language and postures that needlessly antagonize people with whom you
    disagree; distinguish between their legitimate and illegitimate views; take stock of their experiences. This, too,
    requires imagination.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Finding shared ground wherever possible in pursuit of the common good is not most people’s
    favorite brand of politics. But it’s the politics we need for the emergency that’s staring us in the face, if only
    we will see it.</p>
