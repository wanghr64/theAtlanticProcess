      gutting newsrooms and damaging democracy.</span></p>
  <hr class="calibre10" />
  <p class="calibre_6">I’m from Chicago originally and still a close reader of the <span class="italic">Tribune</span>.
    It’s astonishing how bad things have gotten for a once-vibrant institution. The pages are thinner. Associated Press
    wire stories have replaced original reporting. There are spelling errors throughout.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">I keep asking myself one question as more and more local and regional news outlets face cuts or
    fall completely: How do people know what’s going on in their own backyard?</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">I think the answer is that they really don’t, or they get their news from distorted sources. Some
    of my friends and family now get their Chicago coverage only from cable news or the latest viral Facebook post.
    Usually, it’s painting the city as a crime-ridden hellhole or bashing the mayor for something partisan—no local
    nuance, no analysis, just a selective distortion of what’s happening on the ground. Many of those same people used
    to get their news from the <span class="italic">Trib</span>’s center-right perspective. Now they get it from
    national outlets that couldn’t care less about their city.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Alden Global Capital’s track record has already shown that it is perfectly willing to destroy one
    of America’s most storied papers for a quick buck. It’s a shame no civic-minded, wealthy Chicagoan stepped up to
    save the paper from its slow but certain death, and the city is worse off because of that.</p>

  <p class="calibre_6">The growing prevalence of personalities like Randall Duncan Smith and companies like Alden Global
    Capital showcases the deep problems the United States is facing. Do we really value this kind of unbridled
    capitalism? How is it that we—by way of elected officials—tolerate behavior that is so destructive to our way of
    life?</p>

  <p class="calibre_6">Alden deserves the scorn it gets for its brutish (but profitable) approach. But American
    journalism faces a crisis bigger than nefarious hedge funds.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">The real problem comes from the fall of America as a republic of letters. American civic
    education hasn’t emphasized the vital role of journalism as the fourth estate, as important to the good society as
    the separation of powers or checks and balances in the federal government.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Now, Americans don’t pay for news anymore and don’t fund the local papers that kept communities
    intact and local governments in line.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Yes, Alden is killing off papers left and right. But why does the hedge fund buy these papers?
    Because previous owners didn’t see a viable future thanks to an apathetic public. The media industry isn’t
    blameless. But the problem goes deeper than the journalistic failures of recent years …</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">To save [the newspaper industry], we’ll need an effort of renewal to restore local institutions
    and to restore respectability to journalism.</p>

  <p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">The Atlantic</span>’s report highlights an important threat to journalism
    and civic awareness. But you overstate the impact on the <span class="italic">Chicago Tribune</span>. The <span
      class="italic">Trib</span>’s all-pro journalists, such as the veteran investigator Ray Long, continue to break
    major stories of political corruption. And the Springfield capitol bureau is staffed once again. The truth is bad
    enough. You shouldn’t make it even worse.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10" />
  <p class="calibre_6">Every day I read the <span class="italic">Hartford Courant</span>, one of the papers that Alden
    Global Capital owns. Many people in Connecticut are concerned about the ongoing dismantling of the <span
      class="italic">Courant</span>, the oldest continuously published newspaper in the United States. However, we
    already have an alternative: a digital, nonprofit newspaper immune to the depredations of vultures. <span
      class="italic">The Connecticut Mirror</span> is now more than 10 years old, providing indispensable news to the
    public, not to mention state and local government. I read it every day alongside the <span
      class="italic">Courant</span>.</p>

  <p class="calibre_6">McKay Coppins’s article is troubling for the non-billionaires among us, which is why it’s so
    important to acknowledge the organizations that are fighting to provide our communities with local accountability.
    Here in Illinois, ProPublica and the outlets that make up the Chicago Independent Media Alliance are rising stars in
    the shadow of the <span class="italic">Chicago Tribune</span>.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Many of my favorite news resources today are nonprofits that rely on the support of their readers
    for revenue. I may not have the funds to buy out Alden Global Capital’s newspaper empire, but I hope that other
    readers will make it their mission to help a local news site thrive in whatever small way they are able.</p>

  <p class="calibre_6">McKay Coppins replies:</p>
  <p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">To respond to Loren Wassell’s letter: There’s no doubt that the
    </span>Tribune<span class="italic">’s journalists continue to work heroically under adverse conditions to keep their
      readers informed. But when a paper loses a quarter of its newsroom virtually overnight, its quality will
      inevitably suffer, as I believe my reporting demonstrated. Those who remain in the </span>Trib<span
      class="italic">’s shrinking newsroom deserve credit. They—and their city—also deserve better management than Alden
      has provided.</span></p>

  <p class="calibre_6">The New Meth</p>
  <p class="calibre_6"><span class="italic">The drug is creating a wave of mental illness and contributing to
      homelessness. In November, Sam Quinones </span><a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/the-new-meth/620174/"><span class="italic">reported
        on</span></a><span class="italic"> how it spread and what it’s doing to people.</span></p>
  <hr class="calibre10" />
  <p class="calibre_6">Thank you for the excellent article on meth use. I’ve worked with crime victims for many years
    and seen the devastation that meth and other drugs cause victims, offenders, and the community at large. My local
    elected officials have swallowed hook, line, and sinker the idea that drug distribution is “victimless.” Hopefully
    many people will read Sam Quinones’s work, and a wider recognition of the need to both offer treatment and protect
    society will take root.</p>

  <hr class="calibre10" />
  <p class="calibre_6">Sam Quinones’s article confirmed what I know all too well as a family- and addiction-medicine
    physician working in Portland, Oregon. We have lost the War on Drugs, and we will be tallying the casualties for
    generations to come. Being on the I-5 corridor has kept the Pacific Northwest on the leading edge of the innovative,
    highly addictive, synthetic drugs manufactured by drug cartels. The devastation for our families and communities is
    laid out before us on the streets. And there seems to be no end in sight.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Now is the time for a fresh approach to the problems of illicit drugs and their effect on the
    health and wellness of our communities. Substance-use disorders, like many other chronic medical problems, are
    largely a result of system failures, including delayed intervention. Though many initially turn to illicit drug use
    as a means of coping with trauma, at a certain point, the unhealthy behavior is not a choice. It is time to
    decriminalize the behavior of using drugs.</p>
  <p class="calibre_6">Mr. Quinones makes another important point. If we desire healthy, vibrant communities rooted in
    peace, social justice, and sustainability, then we cannot turn away from these faces of “living addiction.” We will
    need extraordinary outreach for those who are already marginalized because of mental-health issues, including
    substance-use disorders. After all, a community is only as strong as its most vulnerable member.</p>

    the events that transpired a year ago were just a warm-up. The hand-scrawled cover line offers an urgent warning. On
    some occasions, typography speaks louder than any image could.</p>
